=========

1.0 (unreleased)
----------------

- Create ``plone.mockup`` Python package out of ``mockup``, which is reverted
  to a non-Python package and made installable via bower again.
  This package includes a git submodule, but with a RO url. For developing
  mockup, use a seperate mockup checkout.
